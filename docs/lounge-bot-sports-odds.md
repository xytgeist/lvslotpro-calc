## Workflow (v1 shipped)

```text
Calendar sport pick (portal)  →  lounge-odds-ingest (manual) or lounge-odds-poll (cron)
  →  +EV engine (h2h / spreads / totals devig)  →  ⚡ edge alert OR Coffee & Covers morning post  →  feed
```

| **Post kind** | When | Example tone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Edge** | Best +EV line (ML / spread / total) clears **`min_edge_pct`** | See example below |
| **Coffee & Covers** | No edge on manual fetch, or **`daily_slates`** morning poll | See example below |
| **Best Bet of the Hour** | Hourly cron **`best_bet_hour`** (or portal button) | See example below |
| **Arb Watch** | **`poll_edges`** finds **≥ 3%** guaranteed cross-book arb | See example below |
| **Sharp Report Card** | **`poll_edges`** when meaningful sharp/steam/RLM move (10–60 min snapshot) | See example below |
| **Value Bet Radar** | **`value_bet_radar`** cron every ~30 min during peak hours (or portal button) | See example below |
| **Slate** (legacy) | When **`coffee_covers_enabled = false`** | See legacy example below |

**Caption style:** factual labels only (no opinion phrases). Line breaks between sections. Plain keyboard punctuation only (colons, commas, hyphens in odds ... no middle dots or em/en dashes). Sportsbook names use brand labels (FanDuel, MyBookie) ... not bare domains (avoids auto-linkify in feed).

**+EV example:**
```text
⚡ World Cup: France vs Paraguay (Sat 2PM PT)

France ML +718 at MyBookie
Fair +652 (9 books)
+8.8% edge on ML
```

**Coffee & Covers example:**
```text
☕ Coffee & Covers 💵

**Thread part (one per calendar sport today), e.g. MLB:**
```text
⚾ MLB

Yankees vs Red Sox (Sat 1PM PT)
Yankees -110 (FanDuel), Red Sox +105 (DraftKings)
```

When no spread clears **+4%** EV, the root post opens with: *No strong covers today - sitting on hands until we see better value.*

**Best Bet of the Hour example:**
```text
🔥 Best Bet of the Hour
Padres ML +219 @ lowvig
Padres vs Dodgers (Sat 7:11 PM PT)
+7.8% EV
Market consensus implies ~42% chance Padres win, but they're available at +219. This is currently the sharpest edge on the board.
```

**Legacy slate example:**
```text
World Cup slate

France vs Paraguay (Sat 2PM PT)
France +145 (DraftKings), Draw +652 (FanDuel), Paraguay +718 (MyBookie)

Germany vs Portugal (Sat 5PM PT)
Germany -110 (FanDuel), Portugal +105 (DraftKings)
```

Long posts may still truncate with `+N more games today.` at the **2000-char** caption cap (subscriber/bot tier). **+EV alerts and morning posts** only consider games **kicking off today (PT)** that have not started yet.

**Morning automation:** pg_cron **`daily_slates`** every **5 min**, **6-8am PT** (random post minute per bot). **`poll_edges`** every **15 min**, **24/7** ... posts ⚡ when a line clears **`min_edge_pct`** on **today's unplayed** games (no time-of-day gate). Migrations **`20260704230000`** + **`20260704240000`** + Vault — see **`lounge-odds-poll/README.md`**.

**`review_mode`:** `automatic`. Target volume: **~2 posts/day** + optional edge alerts when lines misprice (caps below).

## Freemium feed gating

Migration **`20260704260000`**: **`community_feed_posts.subscriber_only`**. RLS + **`lounge_viewer_is_subscriber_or_staff()`** hides subscriber-only posts from anon and signed-in free users; active **`has_active_subscription`** or staff see them.

Each publish path sets **`subscriber_only`** from **`alert_audience`** (see portal matrix above).

---

## +EV engine

Shared logic: **`supabase/functions/_shared/loungeBotOddsCaption.ts`**, **`loungeBotSportAnalysis.ts`** (sport-weighted ranking), and **`loungeBotCoffeeAndCovers.ts`** (morning covers + ML spots).

### Edge alerts (multi-market)

1. Filter events: **today (PT)** kickoffs not yet started (after optional **48h** API pre-filter), **3+ books**, in-season sport keys from The Odds API **`active`**
2. Scan **`h2h`**, **`spreads`**, and **`totals`** (sport-weighted tie-break when EV is close; see **Sport-specific analysis** below)
3. Per book: devig outcomes → fair implied prob per side
4. **Consensus:** average fair probs across books
5. **EV on $1** at best available American price vs consensus
6. Publish if **`evPct >= min_edge_pct`** (WNBA **+0.5%** bump) and **`evPct <= 15`** (stale-data filter)

### Coffee & Covers (morning)

**`generateCoffeeAndCovers()`** in **`loungeBotCoffeeAndCovers.ts`**:

| Section | Threshold | Max per sport |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Covers** (spread/handicap) | **+4%** EV on $1 | **3** per sport (merged in root) |
| **ML spots** | **+3%** EV on $1 | **3** per sport (merged in root) |
| **Dog of the Day** | Highest **+EV underdog** (ML plus money or spread **+points**) across the full slate | **One** pick with odds, +EV %, and short reason vs consensus |
| **On Tap (tomorrow)** | Tomorrow spread/ML at or within **1%** of bar | **Max 3** across all sports |
| **Best Lines 👇** | Best ML + book per outcome | One **thread part** per calendar sport (header: sport emoji + label, e.g. `🎾 Wimbledon`) |

Spread devig mirrors h2h: per-book no-vig fair probs on each spread side, consensus average, EV at best juice. Dedupe key: **`coffee:daily:{ptDay}`** (one post per bot per PT day). Log **`post_kind: coffee_covers`**. Root post ends with **`Best Lines 👇`**; lines board lives in author thread parts (`feed_comments.is_thread_part`).

Set **`coffee_covers_enabled = false`** on **`lounge_bot_odds_config`** to fall back to legacy slate check-ins.

**`min_edge_pct`:** minimum **+EV percent on $1 stake** (default **2**). Column default + new bots use **2**; existing rows may still be **4** until saved in portal.

### Line movement alerts (poll_edges)

**`loungeBotLineMovement.ts`** — runs on every **`poll_edges`** tick (15 min, 24/7):

1. Load prior lines from **`lounge_odds_event_lines`** (saved on the **last poll**, ~**15 min** ago when cron is on schedule)
2. Fetch current odds (**`h2h`**, **`spreads`**, **`totals`** when line movement enabled)
3. **Only compare** if prior snapshot age is **8–22 minutes** (15-min poll jitter). Too fresh → skip; too stale → re-baseline without alert.
4. Compare consensus vs that snapshot; flag when **in that interval**:
   - Spread moves **≥ 0.5** pts (config **`min_spread_move_pts`**)
   - Total moves **≥ 0.5** pts (**`min_total_move_pts`**)
   - ML moves **≥ 20** American pts in the interval (e.g. +150 → +130, -140 → -160; config **`min_ml_move_pts`**, default **20**)
4. Classify: **`sharp_move`** (≥ 1 pt or large ML), **`steam`** (fast multi-book sync), **`rlm`** (spread vs ML diverge), **`line_movement`** (minor — internal only, no feed post)
5. Post feed alert for **`sharp_move`**, **`steam`**, and **`rlm`** only (minor **`line_movement`** feeds **Sharp Report Card** but not standalone alerts)
6. Upsert new snapshot (first poll = baseline only, no alerts)

Dedupe: one alert per movement direction per game/market/outcome per PT day. Cap: **`max_line_alerts_per_day`** (default **12**). Disable via **`line_movement_enabled = false`**.

### Live in-game edge + period reports (poll_edges)

**`loungeBotLiveContent.ts`** — same **15 min** cron as edge + line movement:

| Post kind | Trigger | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`in_game_edge`** | Live game (commenced, not completed per scores API) | **+EV ≥ `min_live_edge_pct`** (default **4%**) on **ML, spreads, or totals** |
| **`period_report`** | Sport-specific period milestone (halftime, NHL period end, MLB 5th-inning heuristic) | Best **+EV** lines for remainder of game; header merges milestone + score (e.g. **Halftime Report - Chiefs 14-10 Bills**) |

Period milestones use elapsed-time heuristics per sport (not play-by-play). State in **`lounge_odds_game_period_state`** — one report per game per milestone. Caps: **`max_live_alerts_per_day`** (default **8**), **`max_period_reports_per_day`** (default **6**). Toggle via **`live_edge_enabled`** / **`period_report_enabled`**.

### Arb Watch (poll_edges)

**`loungeBotArbWatch.ts`** — runs on every **`poll_edges`** tick (reuses the same odds fetch; **no extra API credits**). **Posts only when** a clean cross-book arb clears **`min_arb_profit_pct`** (default **3%**). Silent otherwise.

1. For each today's unplayed game, find the **best price per outcome** across all books (ML, spreads at matched lines, totals at matched numbers)
2. Arb when sum of implied probs **&lt; 100%** (combined &lt; 1.0)
3. Require legs from **≥ 2 different books**; reject arbs **&gt; 12%** (stale data filter)
4. Caption includes both sides, books, guaranteed **%**, and balanced stake split on **$100** total
5. Dedupe **`arb_watch:{ptDay}:{eventId}:{market}`** per day; cap **`max_arb_alerts_per_day`** (default **6**)

```text
🔒 Arb Watch
Risk-Free Opportunity

France vs Paraguay (Sat 2PM PT)

France ML +102 @ FanDuel
Draw ML +210 @ DraftKings

Guaranteed +3.4% profit no matter the result.
Stake $51 on France and $49 on Draw ($100 total) for $3.40 profit.
```

**Sharp Report Card example:**
```text
📊 Sharp Report Card

Chiefs -4 moved from -3 to -4 at multiple sharp books.

Sharp money appears to be coming in on Kansas City as the number shortens across books. Line has steamed over the last ~15 minutes.
NFL: Chiefs vs Raiders (Sun 1:25 PM PT). This is one to watch closely.
```

### Best Bet of the Hour (hourly)

**`loungeBotBestBetHour.ts`** — dedicated **`best_bet_hour`** poll action (pg_cron **minute 5 every hour**):

1. Scan every calendar sport today via fresh Odds API fetch (**`h2h`**, **`spreads`**, **`totals`**)
2. Include **today's unplayed** kickoffs plus **live** in-progress games
3. **`findPlusEvOpportunities`** across all three markets; keep highest **+EV** play slate-wide
4. Minimum **`min_best_bet_hour_ev_pct`** (default **4%**); stale cap **15%**
5. Tie-break: higher **+EV** → sport popularity (**NFL > NBA > MLB**, etc.) → calendar **`priority`** → more books
6. Dedupe **`best_bet_hour:{PT hour bucket}`** — one post per bot per PT hour

Disable via **`best_bet_hour_enabled = false`**. Audience key **`best_bet_hour`** in portal matrix.

### Sharpe's Sharp Report (poll_edges)

**`loungeBotSharpReport.ts`** — one narrative **Sharp Report Card** per poll when meaningful movement is found:

1. Compare current lines to stored snapshot (**10–60 min** age; wider than tick-level line alerts)
2. Reuse **`detectLineMovements`**; keep **steam**, **sharp_move**, **RLM**, or spread **≥ 0.5** / ML **≥ 20** pt moves
3. Pick **one** best game slate-wide (movement score → NFL/NBA/MLB popularity)
4. Short analytical caption with cautious language (`appears to be`, `leaning`, etc.) ... **no fabricated injury/news context**
5. Dedupe **`sharp_report:{ptDay}:{eventId}:...`**; cap **`max_sharp_reports_per_day`** (default **4**)

Runs **before** line-movement snapshot upsert so both read the same prior lines. Disable via **`sharp_report_enabled = false`**.

### Human-paced publishing (scheduled queue)

Odds alerts no longer burst-post when several qualify in one **`poll_edges`** tick. **`loungeBotPublishSchedule.ts`** queues captions with randomized delay:

| Priority | Alert kinds | Typical delay after spacing gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Urgent** | Arb Watch | ~15s–2min after min gap |
| **Normal** | +EV edge, Best Bet, Value Radar, in-game edge, Starter Spotlight, Injury Impact | ~2–10min after min gap |
| **Low** | Line movement, Sharp Report, period reports, Confirmed Starters, Rest + Travel | ~6–20min after min gap |

**`min_post_gap_minutes`** (default **8**) enforces minimum spacing between any Scott posts. **`lounge_bot_scheduled_posts`** is drained every minute by pg_cron **`lounge_bot_publish_scheduled_odds`** → **`lounge-bot-publish-due`** (`publishScheduledOdds: true`). Stale pending rows (**> 3h**) cancel automatically. **Coffee & Covers** still posts immediately (threaded morning post).

### Value Bet Radar (peak hours, ~30 min)

**`loungeBotValueBetRadar.ts`** — dedicated **`value_bet_radar`** poll action (pg_cron **minutes 5 and 35 every hour**; Edge gates **8am–10pm PT**):

1. Scan every calendar sport today via fresh Odds API fetch (**`h2h`**, **`spreads`**, **`totals`**)
2. Include **today's unplayed** kickoffs plus **live** in-progress games (same window as Best Bet)
3. **`findPlusEvOpportunities`** slate-wide; keep **2–3** highest **+EV** plays (min **3.5%** default)
4. **Variety:** prefer one pick per sport first, then fill remaining slots; one play per game
5. Dedupe **`value_bet_radar:{PT half-hour bucket}`** — one post per bot per 30-min window; cap **`max_value_bet_radar_posts_per_day`** (default **20**)

Disable via **`value_bet_radar_enabled = false`**. Default audience **`all`** (snackable feed content).

### Context alerts (factual Rundown + odds, `poll_edges`)

**`loungeBotContextAlerts.ts`** — up to **one** context post per sport per **`poll_edges`** tick when data qualifies. Captions are **data-only** (no interpretive commentary). Requires **`THERUNDOWN_API_KEY`** for starters, injuries, and rest/B2B; each kind also needs a qualifying **+EV** pick on the same game (**`min_edge_pct`**).

| `post_kind` | Header | Data source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`starter_spotlight`** | 🔦 Starter Spotlight | Confirmed starters (pitchers, QBs, etc. when Rundown has data) + best +EV pick |
| **`confirmed_starters`** | ✅ Confirmed Starters | Compact starter list + pick (skipped if Starter Spotlight already posted/scheduled that day for same game) |
| **`injury_impact`** | ⚠️ Injury Impact | Hard injury status (OUT, IR, etc.) + pick |
| **`rest_travel_edge`** | 🛫 Rest + Travel Advantage | 7-day Rundown schedule + venue table: rest gap ≥ 1 day, +EV on **rested** team; optional travel line (≥800 mi or cross-TZ) |
| **`fade_the_public`** | 🚫 Fade the Public | **Off by default** — needs public betting % feed (not in Rundown OpenAPI) |

Priority when multiple qualify: injury → starter spotlight → rest → confirmed starters. Daily cap **`max_context_alerts_per_day`** (default **8**). Toggle per kind via **`starter_spotlight_enabled`**, **`confirmed_starters_enabled`**, **`injury_impact_enabled`**, **`rest_travel_edge_enabled`**, **`fade_the_public_enabled`**. Default audience **Subs**.

**Rest + Travel logic (`loungeBotRestTravel.ts` + `loungeSportsVenues.ts`):**

1. Load Rundown events for **today + prior 7 PT days** (cached 45m per sport/date).
2. Per team: days since last game, B2B (`days === 1`), NFL short week (`days < 6`), bye (no game in window).
3. Qualify when fatigued side is B2B or NFL short week and rested side has **≥1 day** more rest (or bye vs short week).
4. **+EV pick must be on the rested team** (h2h/spreads only).
5. Travel line only when Haversine **≥800 mi** or home-market TZ bucket changes (`loungeSportsVenues.ts` seed). Pre-game: falls back to home-team arena coords when Rundown `venue_location` is blank.
6. Copy stays **team schedule** only (never pitcher workload).

## Sports calendar

Table **`lounge_sports_betting_calendar`** — seeded for 2026 major events.

RPC **`admin_lounge_sports_betting_calendar_today()`** → portal dropdown.

Captions prefix category label from calendar row (e.g. `Wimbledon: ...`).

**Portal calendar editor:** Scott bot **`/?tab=bots`** → **View calendar** → date picker, **Add event** / **Edit** (migration **`20260704320000`**). Rows include optional **`coverage_tier`** (migration **`20260704330000`**).

---

## Scott coverage scope (priority tiers)

Canonical logic: **`supabase/functions/_shared/loungeBotCoverageScope.ts`**.

| Tier | Cover | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1 · Heavy** | Always prioritize | NFL, NBA, MLB, NCAAF, NHL, Premier League / top European soccer, World Cup |
| **2 · Medium** | Regular rotation | Grand Slam tennis, PGA majors, UFC/MMA, WNBA, NCAA basketball (incl. March Madness) |
| **3 · Opportunistic** | When signal is strong | Olympics, F1, boxing, esports |

**Rules (Edge + portal):**

- **`poll_edges`** scans calendar rows sorted by coverage rank (tier + priority + tournament/marquee boost).
- **Best Bet of the Hour**, **Value Bet Radar**, and **Sharp Report** compare candidates by **coverage rank first**.
- A lower tier wins only on **exceptional +EV** (default **+2%** gap vs the other pick) or **exceptional line movement** (movement score gap **≥ 15**).
- Big events: set **`kind`** = `tournament` or `marquee` and raise **`priority`** (e.g. World Cup **100**, UFC 329 **95**) for a temporary boost on active dates.

**Calendar seed (`20260704330000`):** adds Premier League, top Euro soccer, NCAA basketball season, **UFC 329 (Jul 11)**, four men's golf majors, boxing marquee. Placeholder rows for Winter Olympics / F1 / esports ship **disabled** until Odds API keys are confirmed.

**Golf note:** major keys are **outright winner** markets (`golf_masters_tournament_winner`, etc.) ... Scott's +EV engine today targets **h2h / spreads / totals** game markets. Calendar rows prime captions and future outright support; live scans skip inactive API keys.

## Sport-specific analysis (pick ranking + voice)

Canonical logic: **`supabase/functions/_shared/loungeBotSportAnalysis.ts`**.

### Engine behavior (Odds API only today)

| Sport | Market priority when EV is close | Min EV notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **NFL / NCAAF / NBA / NCAAB / WNBA / NHL** | **Spread-heavy** ... spreads > totals > ML | WNBA adds **+0.5%** to every configured min EV bar |
| **MLB / MMA / tennis / boxing** | **ML-heavy** ... ML > spread > total; slight underdog ML boost | Underdog ML tie-break |
| **Soccer** | Balanced 1X2 / handicap / totals; **draw ML** tie-break | `h2h` is 3-way home/draw/away |

**Where it applies:**

- **`findPlusEvOpportunities`** / **`pickBestOddsCandidate`** ... sport-weighted sort when raw EV gap **< 2%**
- **+EV edge alerts** (`poll_edges`) ... same **3-market** scan as Best Bet / Value Radar (no longer ML-only)
- **Best Bet of the Hour**, **Value Bet Radar**, **live in-game edge** ... inherit WNBA bump via `effectiveMinEvPct`
- **Coffee & Covers** spread covers + Dog of the Day ... WNBA bump on spread thresholds too

**Still deferred without verified Rundown (or other) feed data:** player props, fight method narratives. Injury/headline copy is appended **only** when **`THERUNDOWN_API_KEY`** returns a matching status or `event_headline`.

### Target voice per sport (caption examples)

Use these as editorial north stars; post kinds may differ but tone should match.

**NFL & college football** ... spreads + totals, 0.5pt moves matter, covers in Coffee & Covers.

```text
📊 Sharp Move – Chiefs -3 moved to -3.5 across 6 books (+4.2% EV on Chiefs -3.5)
```

**NBA** ... spreads + totals; live halftime / in-game edges.

```text
🔥 Best Bet of the Hour – Lakers -4.5 @ +105 (+5.8% EV) vs Warriors
```

**MLB** ... ML + run line (`spreads`); underdog value.

```text
📡 Value Bet Radar – Padres ML +219 (+7.8% EV) vs Dodgers
```

**Soccer** ... 1X2 (`h2h`), handicap (`spreads`), totals; draw can be high value.

```text
☕ Coffee & Covers – Draw ML +718 (+9.6% EV) in France vs Paraguay
```

**NHL** ... ML, puck line, totals; period milestone posts for live.

```text
📈 Line Movement – Oilers -1.5 Puck Line moved from -110 to +105
```

**Tennis (Grand Slams)** ... match ML underdogs.

```text
🔥 Giron ML +900 (+4.2% EV) vs Zverev – Wimbledon
```

**WNBA** ... NBA-like markets, slightly higher EV bar (+0.5%).

```text
📡 Value Bet Radar – Valkyries ML +155 (+3.7% EV) vs Dream
```

**UFC / MMA** ... ML; Dog of the Day hunts big +EV dogs.

```text
Dog of the Day – Underdog +450 (+6.1% EV)
```

### TheRundown context layer

Canonical logic: **`supabase/functions/_shared/loungeBotRundownContext.ts`**.

| Post kind | Benefit | Context sources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Best Bet of the Hour | High | MLB starting pitcher; key OUT/status on picked team |
| Sharp Report Card | High | OUT/status on moved side; `event_headline` |
| Coffee & Covers / Dog of the Day | High | Pitchers, OUT/status, soccer-style headlines |
| In-Game Edge / Halftime | High | Live foul trouble; questionable/doubtful status |
| Value Bet Radar | Medium | Inline MLB starter suffix on bullet |
| Line Movement / Steam / RLM | Medium | OUT/status or headline when relevant |
| Arb Watch | Low | Skipped |

**Fetch policy:** resolve Rundown `event_id` once per game (team names + PT date, `offset=420`), cache ~45 min, fetch at **publish** time only (not every odds poll). Never fabricate context.

**Setup:**

```bash
supabase secrets set THERUNDOWN_API_KEY="your_key" --project-ref kcosfvmreeiosdjdzycb
```

### Future enrichment

Planned additions **after** more feed coverage:

- MLB starting pitchers + bullpen context in Coffee & Covers / Sharp Report
- NBA/WNBA injury availability for live edge captions
- UFC fight method / weight-class metadata for prop expansion

Player props and deep injury narratives may still need a dedicated injuries feed beyond Rundown roster `status`.

## Manual posts and replies (portal)

On **`/?tab=bots`**, any bot card includes:

| Control | RPC / behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Post as @handle** | **`admin_lounge_bot_publish_post`** — inserts feed post as bot; logs **`post_kind: other`** |
| **Reply on any post** | Paste Lounge **`?post=`** link or UUID → **Load post** → thread + **Reply as bot** on any visible post (**`20260704220000`**) |
| **Replies** on each recent bot post | Same reply UI on Scott's own posts in **Feed posts** |

Works for Scott Share and all other bots. Does not bypass day/hour caps on automated ingest (manual posts are separate). Bot reply body cap: **2000** chars (via **`lounge_feed_caption_max_for_user`**).
