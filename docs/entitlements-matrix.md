# Entitlements matrix ... multi-product paywalls (source of truth)

**Purpose:** One place for **what each product unlocks**, separate from **how we sell it** (Stripe) and **who sees which Subscribe button** in UI. Use this before RLS, webhooks, and new checkout flows.

**Status:** **Planned / partial.** Rows marked **shipped** match `docs/access-tiers.md` today. Rows marked **planned** capture Ryan decisions from **2026-07-18** (creator fan subs, Edge Pro platform tier, add-ons). Implementation order: **§6**.

**Related:** `docs/access-tiers.md` (anonymous / free / Slots Edge / staff today), `docs/affiliates.md` (curated affiliate commission on **EdgeTilt** plans, not fan subs), `docs/social-feed-roadmap.md` (Freemium), `supabase/chat_phase1.sql` (chat + upgrade path notes).

**Not legal advice:** Creator fan rooms, paid groups, and gambling-adjacent UGC still need ToS, reporting, and payment-processor review regardless of encryption plans.

## 1. Product catalog

## 2. Capability matrix

Legend: **Y** = yes · **N** = no · **Own** = only on content you author · **Gate** = paywall modal · **TBD** = product decision open

## 3. How products combine (stacking rules)

| Rule | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| **Independent grants** | Edge Pro, Slots Edge, each creator fan sub, and each add-on are **separate entitlements**. Owning one does not imply owning another. |
| **UI** | Profile shows **Support @{handle}** for fan subs; Settings / Subscribe modal shows **Edge Pro** and **Slots Edge**; never one ambiguous button. |
| **RLS** | Server checks the **specific grant** for each action (e.g. fan post → `has_creator_sub(me, author)`; Edge Pro reply gate → author setting + viewer's `edge-pro` grant). |
| **Affiliate promos** | Creator **affiliate** codes apply to **EdgeTilt catalog** checkouts only, not fan subs (`docs/affiliates.md`). |
| **Founding coupons** | EdgeTilt platform catalog only; no stacking with affiliate codes (existing rule). |

---

## 4. Engineering model (target)

Single read path for clients and RLS helpers:

```text
get_my_entitlements(user_id) → {
  platform: { edge_pro: bool, slots_edge_tier: 'none'|'starter'|'pro'|'lifetime', addons: string[] },
  creator_fans: [ { creator_user_id, status, period_end } ],
  staff: { is_staff, is_admin }
}
```

**Planned tables (names TBD in migrations):**

| Store | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `user_subscriptions` | **Shipped** ... EdgeTilt Stripe subs |
| `user_entitlements` or product-specific rows | **Planned** ... Edge Pro, add-ons |
| `creator_monetization_profiles` | **Planned** ... price tier, Connect account, fan room id |
| `creator_subscriptions` | **Planned** ... fan ↔ creator Stripe sub id, status |
| `chat_room_members.role` | **Shipped** base ... extend with `moderator` + room owner |

**Webhooks:** `stripe-webhook` routes by `product_slug` / metadata to the correct grant writer. Fan subs use **Connect** + `application_fee_percent: 30` (or equivalent).

---

## 5. Creator fan sub ... v1 scope (locked for design)

| Item | v1 choice |
| --- | --- |
| Who can enable | **Verified** users + completed Connect onboarding |
| Pricing | **Preset monthly tiers only** (no custom amount). Creators pick **one** tier at enable time; change tier later via settings (new subscribers at new price; existing subs follow Stripe price-change rules). |
| Tier MSRP (monthly) | **$4.99**, **$9.99**, **$19.99**, **$49.99**, **$99.99**, **$149.99**, **$249.99** ... locked **2026-07-21** (Ryan; added $149 / $249) |
| Tier keys (Stripe / DB) | `fan-tier-499`, `fan-tier-999`, `fan-tier-1999`, `fan-tier-4999`, `fan-tier-9999`, `fan-tier-14999`, `fan-tier-24999` ... one shared Connect Price per key platform-wide |
| Benefits | Fan-only posts + one **Private Subs** fan group chat (creator-named, description + topic keywords, editable avatar) |
| Chat | **Not E2EE**; creator-owned moderation (§5 UI after tab ships); **Private Subs** tab lists all live fan rooms with in-tab search (name, description, keywords); member rooms highlighted + top; **not** in Inbox; message access members-only |
| Cancel | Access through **paid period end**, then remove room membership |
| Platform fee | **30%** EdgeTilt / **70%** creator |

---

## 6. Phased rollout (recommended)

| Phase | Deliverable | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | This doc + `get_my_entitlements()` shape agreed | n/a |
| **1** | Entitlement RPC + Stripe routing refactor (Edge Pro stub ok) | Phase 0 |
| **2** | **Creator fan sub MVP** (Connect, checkout, fan posts, fan room, search gate, mod roles) | Phase 1 |
| **3** | **Edge Pro** (ads off, feed filter, author reply restrictions) | Phase 1 |
| **4** | Add-on SKUs + Lifetime/Pro bundle rules | Slots vertical |
| **5** | Fan room E2EE (optional) | Phase 2 traction + crypto design |

Track implementation in `docs/test-buildout-backlog.md` when Phase 1 work starts. **Detailed task breakdown (2026-07-21):** **`docs/test-buildout-backlog.md` § Creator fan subs — product backlog** (Settings manage subs, composer audience, feed teaser, **Chat Private Subs tab §4**, room mod tools §5, **creator new-sub awareness §7**, audio hang out).

## 7. Revision log

| Date | Change |
| --- | --- |
| 2026-07-18 | Initial matrix: multi-product catalog, capability table, creator fan sub v1, Edge Pro platform tier, stacking rules, engineering target, rollout phases (Ryan spec). |
| 2026-07-22 | **Private Subs** chat tab spec locked (Ryan): creator-named fan rooms + description + topic keywords + editable avatar; full catalog with in-tab search; member rows highlighted and top; fan rooms excluded from Inbox; zero-sub rooms still listed; §5 mod UI may ship after tab. Backlog **`test-buildout-backlog.md` §4**. |
| 2026-07-21 | Creator fan sub tiers expanded to **seven** monthly MSRPs: added **$149.99** / **$249.99** (`fan-tier-14999`, `fan-tier-24999`); migration **`20260721180000`**. |
| 2026-07-20 | Creator fan sub preset tiers locked to **five** monthly MSRPs: $4.99 / $9.99 / $19.99 / $49.99 / $99.99 + tier keys `fan-tier-*`. |
| 2026-07-21 | Feed teaser model for fan-only posts (visible in main feed, partial line + subscribe CTA, auto-follow on sub) added to product backlog; supersedes “hide fan-only from non-subs” for **timeline** only — full post detail policy TBD in backlog §3. |
