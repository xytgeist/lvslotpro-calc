# Market Edge voice brief

**Owner:** Ryan (2026-07-06). Reference accounts: Financial Juice, DeItaone (Walter Bloomberg), unusual_whales, Watcher.Guru (crypto urgency only).

---

## Product intent

**General market wire** ... fast, factual, terminal-style. **Not** an SEC filing ticker or company filing bot.

---

## Voice

| Element | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Default format | One tight line (Financial Juice). No forced "JUST IN" prefix. |
| Extra context | DeItaone-style: headline + 0-2 sentences only when needed (compose step decides). |
| Tickers | `$AAPL`, `$MU` when company-specific. |
| Numbers | Lead with `$`, `%`, PMI, bps, auction yields when present. |
| Attribution | Optional trailing `per Bloomberg` / `per Reuters` when paraphrasing. |
| Tone | Third person. No publisher "we/our". No investment advice. |

## Publish rules (Ryan sign-off 2026-07-06)

| Topic | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| **SEC EDGAR filings** | **Never** (8-K, 10-Q, 10-K, any filing notice). |
| **Crypto** | **Sometimes** on Market Edge ... **major stories only** (ETF/regulation, large liquidations, milestone prices, custody/policy). Minor altcoin noise → Crypto Edge or skip. |
| **Trump / political quotes** | **Only when market-linked** (tariffs, stocks, Fed, trade, oil, semis, etc.). Generic political quotes → skip. |
| **Data prints** | **In** ... CPI, ISM, bill/ note auctions, CFTC positioning, SPR inventory, etc. |
| **Sports + prediction markets** | **In** ... Polymarket, Kalshi, odds tied to macro/market angles. |
