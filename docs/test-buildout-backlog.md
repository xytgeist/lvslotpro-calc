# Test buildout backlog (source of truth before production)

Use this file to track work that is implemented and validated on `test` first.
When a feature is ready to promote, replay steps on production using `docs/production-rollout-checklist.md`.
Roadmap and phase ordering live in `docs/social-feed-roadmap.md`.

Do not store secrets in this file.

---

## How to use this file

- Add each new test-side change as a checklist item under the right section.
- Include: what changed, where it lives, how it was validated on test.
- Add a production replay note for every item (or reference checklist section).
- Keep status current so go-live is just execution, not investigation.

### Status labels

- `[ ]` Planned or partially complete
- `[x]` Built and validated on test
- `[-]` Deferred / not in current scope

---

## Roadmap status snapshot

### Phase A - Foundation (DB + auth shaping)

- [x] A1 core `profiles` model in place on test (`handle`, `display_name`, `avatar_url`, `bio`, `role`, `banned_at`, timestamps, constraints/index).
- [ ] A2 feed model finalization is in progress (current table still uses `title + body`; counters/pin columns exist; final caption model and migration sequence not finished).
- [x] A3 baseline RLS/policy shape for public read + authed write + staff moderation is applied on test.
- [ ] A4 rate limiting (`rate_limit_events` + policy/RPC/edge enforcement) not started.

### Phase B - Public read feed

- [x] Basic public read feed path works on test (anon-visible rows, signed-in posting path from Guides).
- [x] Cursor pagination on `(created_at, id)` is implemented with load-more pagination (infinite auto-load polish still optional).
- [ ] Pinned row handling exists at data level but UI/query behavior is not fully finalized to roadmap spec.
- [ ] Logged-out gating for like/comment/search is not fully enforced end-to-end yet.

### Phases C-L

- [ ] Not started as complete feature slices yet (profiles page/gating, media pipeline, comments, likes, search, notifications, moderation, block/mute, permalinks, legal).

## Supabase schema SQL (test first)

- [x] Community feed base schema on test  
  - Change: Added feed table + baseline behavior.
  - Source: `supabase/community_feed_posts.sql`
  - Test validation: Feed insert/read path used by app flows.
  - Production replay: `production-rollout-checklist.md` §2

- [x] Feed Phase A profile/public-read policies on test  
  - Change: Profiles and moderation-related policy/grant alignment for public read.
  - Source: `supabase/feed_phase_a_profiles_public_read.sql`
  - Test validation: Logged-out feed readability + signed-in posting flow.
  - Production replay: `production-rollout-checklist.md` §2

- [ ] Additional SQL parity audit against test history  
  - Change: Reconcile all `supabase/*.sql` used on test that prod may still be missing.
  - Source: `supabase/`
  - Test validation: N/A (tracking task).
  - Production replay: Add each missing SQL file to checklist §2 before go-live.

## RLS / roles / bootstrap rules

- [x] `profiles` admin bootstrap path verified on test  
  - Change: Confirmed operational bootstrap pattern for first admin role update.
  - Source: SQL update on `public.profiles`
  - Test validation: Admin-capable account flow proven on test.
  - Production replay: `production-rollout-checklist.md` §3

- [ ] Staff bootstrap runbook hardening  
  - Change: Add exact operator sequence for moderator creation + audit note.
  - Source: This doc + prod checklist §3
  - Test validation: Pending explicit dry run and copy-paste-ready commands.
  - Production replay: Include final commands in §3.

---

## Edge Functions (test parity before production)

- [x] `process-offer-uploads` deployed and validated on test
- [x] `get-web-push-config` deployed and validated on test
- [x] `send-test-push` deployed and validated on test
- [x] `send-due-offer-reminders` deployed and validated on test
  - Source: `supabase/functions/*`
  - Production replay: `production-rollout-checklist.md` §4

- [ ] Function-by-function smoke notes captured  
  - Change: Record minimal expected input/output for each function.
  - Source: function `README.md` files
  - Test validation: Pending consolidated notes.
  - Production replay: Run same checks post-deploy in prod.

---

## Environment and deploy config (test-side buildout)

- [x] Test Supabase project is canonical during buildout
  - Change: Team workflow set to "full build on test first."
  - Source: `production-rollout-checklist.md` workflow note
  - Test validation: Ongoing process agreement.
  - Production replay: N/A (process guardrail).

- [ ] Capture complete `VITE_*` parity matrix  
  - Change: Track every runtime variable used by app and expected test/prod values (names only, no secret values).
  - Source: Vercel env + `.env.*` files
  - Test validation: Pending inventory.
  - Production replay: Apply in checklist §1.

## Frontend feature buildout on test

- [ ] Active now: A2 feed model finalization (`community_feed_posts` -> v1 shape)
  - Change: finalize content model (`caption/body` direction), migration order (`expand -> app migrate -> contract`), and pinned/count behavior to match roadmap.
  - Source: `supabase/community_feed_posts.sql`, `supabase/feed_phase_a_profiles_public_read.sql`, home feed UI query/render.
  - Test validation: existing feed reads/writes still work through migration sequence with no downtime.
  - Production replay: add finalized SQL/migration steps to checklist §2 before promotion.

- [ ] Next after A2: A4 rate limiting foundation
  - Change: add `rate_limit_events` table + indexes and first enforcement path for posting actions.
  - Source: new SQL + app/edge enforcement path.
  - Test validation: window limits trigger correctly under repeated post attempts.
  - Production replay: checklist §2 and/or §4 (depending on DB-only vs edge function).

---

## Test smoke and release readiness

- [ ] Maintain a "known-good on test" smoke pass list
  - Include: home feed (anon), signed-in posting, offers save, calculators, calendars, push config endpoint.
  - Production replay: mirrors checklist §5.

- [ ] Final pre-prod gate
  - Change: Mark all required sections here as complete before running production rollout checklist.
  - Production replay: Execute checklist top-to-bottom with no skipped items.
