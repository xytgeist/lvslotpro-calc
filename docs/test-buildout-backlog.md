# Test buildout backlog (source of truth before production)

Use this file to track work that is implemented and validated on `test` first.
When a feature is ready to promote, replay steps on production using `docs/production-rollout-checklist.md`.
Roadmap and phase ordering live in `docs/social-feed-roadmap.md`.

**Doc maintenance for agents:** See root **`AGENTS.md`** for when to update this file vs roadmap vs checklist (sessions have no cross-chat memory).

Do not store secrets in this file.

### Build policy (phases)

Work proceeds **in roadmap phase order (A → B → C → …)** with each phase treated as **complete** before moving on. The “Suggested MVP sequencing” block in `social-feed-roadmap.md` is only a **priority hint**, not permission to skip phase scope.

**Hard dependencies:** an item may be completed in a **later** phase only if it truly requires tables or features that do not exist yet. Example: **`community_feed_posts.like_count` / `comment_count` maintenance triggers** (roadmap A2) require **`post_likes`** / **`feed_comments`** (Phases F / E); those triggers are tracked with **Phase F** (and E) until those tables ship.

---

## How to use this file

- Add each new test-side change as a checklist item under the right section.
- Include: what changed, where it lives, how it was validated on test.
- Add a production replay note for every item (or reference checklist section).
- Keep status current so go-live is just execution, not investigation.

### Status labels

- `[ ]` Planned or partially complete
- `[x]` Built and validated on test
- `[-]` Deferred / not in current scope

## Roadmap status snapshot

### Phase A - Foundation (DB + auth shaping)

- [x] A1 core `profiles` model in place on test (`handle`, `display_name`, `avatar_url`, `bio`, `role`, `banned_at`, timestamps, constraints/index).
- [x] **Handle change cadence (test):** `profiles.handle_changed_at` + `BEFORE UPDATE OF handle` cooldown trigger (one change per rolling 7 days; raises `PROFILE_HANDLE_CHANGE_COOLDOWN`). Sources: **`supabase/profile_handle_changed_at.sql`** and tail of **`supabase/profile_lounge_fullscreen.sql`**. Client: **`LoungeProfileFullScreen.jsx`**, **`profileGate.js`** (select includes `handle_changed_at`). **Apply SQL on test** before selects/saves that expect the column.
- [x] A2 feed model on test: `community_feed_posts` is **caption-only** (legacy `title` / `body` dropped after backfill); `edited_at`, pin/moderation columns, denormalized `like_count` / `comment_count` / `repost_count` (after `feed_interactions_phase_ef.sql`).
- [x] A3 baseline RLS/policy shape for public read + authed write + staff moderation is applied on test (includes author **30-minute** `UPDATE` window in SQL).
- [x] A4 **DB-first** posting rate limit on test: `rate_limit_events` + indexes + `BEFORE INSERT` guard on `community_feed_posts` in `feed_phase_a_profiles_public_read.sql` (optional later: Redis/edge limiter per roadmap).
- [x] A2 **counter maintenance:** `supabase/feed_interactions_phase_ef.sql` adds `post_likes`, `post_reposts`, `post_bookmarks`, `feed_comments`, `repost_count`, and triggers to keep `like_count` / `comment_count` / `repost_count` in sync (top-level comments only for post count). **Apply on test** before Lounge persistence works.

### Phase B - Public read feed

- [x] Basic public read feed path works on test (anon-visible rows, signed-in posting path from Guides).
- [x] Cursor pagination on `(created_at, id)` is implemented with load-more pagination (infinite auto-load polish still optional).
- [x] Pinned row: head load fetches at most one pinned row plus first unpinned page; pinned prepended; load-more uses unpinned-only cursor (matches roadmap “prepend one pinned” shape). RLS hides `hidden_at` rows.
- [ ] **Staff pin/unpin (and broader Lounge moderation UI):** not shipped in the client. **Database is ready:** `profiles.role in ('moderator','admin')` may `UPDATE` any feed row (`community_feed_posts_update_moderator` in `supabase/feed_phase_a_profiles_public_read.sql`), and `community_feed_posts_author_guard` lets staff change `pinned` / hide fields without hitting the author-only restriction. Until an in-app mod surface exists, **test pinned ordering** by rerunning the pin block at the end of `supabase/seed/lounge_fake_posts.sql` (clears pins, pins one visible row) or with a one-off `UPDATE` in the Supabase SQL editor (respect the partial unique index: at most one `pinned = true` among non-hidden rows).
- [x] Logged-out Lounge: composer hidden; like/comment/repost/bookmark are read-only (server counts only, no local mutation UI). Feed search is not a Lounge surface yet (Phase G). Guides search remains on Guides tab.

### Phases C-L

- [ ] Phases **D–L** not complete end-to-end; **first slice:** Lounge signed-in persistence for likes, reposts, bookmarks, and flat comments (post detail) + SQL `feed_interactions_phase_ef.sql` (Phase E/F subset). Threaded ranking, search, notifications, etc. still roadmap scope.
- [ ] **Phase C (remaining):** dedicated **`/u/:handle`** profile route + authored-posts list + handle collision + reserved-handle policy as in roadmap. **Shipped on test (partial):** profile completion gate for first post (Lounge + Guides); **full-screen profile editor** in Lounge; **7-day handle change** rule (DB + modals); iOS-focused profile-save mitigations — see **`docs/social-feed-roadmap.md`** Phase C and backlog SQL/FE rows below.
- [ ] **Freemium / subscriptions:** anonymous read-only where required; free-account vs subscriber entitlements (DB + **RLS** + Stripe webhooks); extend shell gating beyond today’s **`browseMode`**. Product spec: fill **`docs/access-tiers.md`**; roadmap: **`docs/social-feed-roadmap.md`** → *Freemium & subscriptions*.

---

## Frontend feature buildout on test

- [x] A2 feed model v1 on test (`community_feed_posts` caption-only)
  - Change: Canonical **`caption`** (≤280); app uses `src/utils/communityFeedPost.js` for inserts and display; **`title` / `body`** removed from schema after phase-A SQL backfill + column drop; feed `.select` lists updated.
  - Source: `supabase/community_feed_posts.sql`, `supabase/feed_phase_a_profiles_public_read.sql`, `src/features/lounge/SocialFeed.jsx`, `src/features/shell/AppShell.jsx` (feed wiring / tab entry), `src/features/guides/GuidesScreen.jsx`, `supabase/seed/lounge_fake_posts.sql`.
  - Test validation: Lounge + Guides posting and feed read verified on test after re-applying phase A SQL.
  - Production replay: `production-rollout-checklist.md` §2 — run current `community_feed_posts.sql` then `feed_phase_a_profiles_public_read.sql` (or equivalent migration) before relying on caption-only clients.

- [x] A4 rate limiting foundation (DB path) on test
  - Change: `rate_limit_events` + rolling-window insert guard on new community posts; app surfaces rate-limit errors in Lounge/Guides.
  - Source: `supabase/feed_phase_a_profiles_public_read.sql` (section 4) + client error handling.
  - Test validation: repeated posts within the configured window return the limiter error; normal posting outside the window succeeds.
  - Production replay: checklist §2; optional §4 only if an edge path is added later.

- [x] A4 **UX:** rate-limit / spam messaging **above** the Lounge composer (`SocialFeed.jsx`) so long expanded drafts do not hide the banner.
  - Change: `postErr` strip placement + styling.
  - Test validation: trigger rate limit with a tall composer; message remains visible without scrolling the draft.
  - Production replay: N/A (client-only).

- [x] Lounge profile fullscreen + handle-save flows (test)
  - Change: Own-profile edit sheet: RLS-safe updates; staff role preserved; handle change **confirm** / **cooldown** modals with **Continue** submitting save; iOS **16px** min on handle/display + post-save **blur + scroll** reset.
  - Source: `src/features/lounge/LoungeProfileFullScreen.jsx`, `src/features/profiles/profileGate.js`, profile selects in `SocialFeed.jsx` as applicable.
  - Test validation: normal user save; mod/admin save; handle modal paths; iOS Safari spot-check after save.
  - Production replay: run **`profile_handle_changed_at.sql`** (or full **`profile_lounge_fullscreen.sql`**) on prod before relying on column/trigger.

- [x] Lounge feed media + repost UX (test)
  - Change: Feed/detail carousels reset to **first slide** when post **re-enters viewport** (`LoungePostFeedMedia.jsx`); **repost** uses **anchored popover** under control including reposted-state actions (`LoungePostArticle.jsx`, `SocialFeed.jsx`); quote composer textarea sizing aligned with main composer; image-cap modal from picker/quote flows.
  - Source: files above.
  - Test validation: scroll multi-image post off/on; repost menu position; quote sheet height + media below text; 7th image attempt shows cap modal.
  - Production replay: N/A (client-only).

---

## Test smoke and release readiness

- [x] Maintain a "known-good on test" smoke pass list
  - **Local automation (2026-05-09):** `npm run lint` and `npm run build` pass; production build shows expected lazy chunks (`SocialFeed`, `OffersCalendar`, `GuidesScreen`, `LocalIntel`, `BankrollTracker`, `CalculatorsTab`, per-game calculator bundles).
  - **Manual on test** (required before prod; mirrors `production-rollout-checklist.md` §5 where applicable):
    1. **Logged out:** Lounge feed loads; composer hidden; like/comment/repost/bookmark read-only; no feed-related console errors.
    2. **Logged in:** Post and reactions; **load-more** cursor pagination for unpinned rows. **Pinned at top:** only applies when a `pinned = true` row exists (no in-app staff pin yet — use `supabase/seed/lounge_fake_posts.sql` tail or SQL editor; see Phase B “Staff pin/unpin” item).
    3. **Heavy tabs once:** Offers, Intel, Bankroll, Calculators (open each game once), Guides — no stuck `Suspense`; calculators work after first open.
    4. **Guides → Ask community:** insert succeeds where RLS allows (profile gate if applicable).
    5. **Offers / calendars / push:** offers save; calendar surfaces; edge paths per §4 / §5 in production checklist (align with Edge Functions rows above).
    6. **Profile (Lounge):** own profile → edit → save display/avatar/about; change handle → **Confirm** → **Continue** completes save without a second Save; within 7 days of a handle change → **Cooldown** → **Continue** keeps handle, saves rest; **mod/admin** save retains `role`.
    7. **Feed carousels:** multi-image post — swipe to a **non-first** slide; scroll the **feed** until that post leaves the scroll area, then scroll back — carousel shows the **first** (left-most) slide (uses feed scroll root + media strip visibility).
    8. **Repost:** menu opens **under** the Repost control on feed + post detail; already-reposted row shows manage actions in the same anchored popover (no bottom sheet).
    9. **Rate limit:** when posting is blocked, error strip is **above** the composer even with a tall draft.
    10. **Quote repost:** sheet opens with a **tall** comment area (not a single-line box); images/GIF one line below text; picking more than **6** images shows cap modal (composer + quote sheet).
  - **Sign-off:** Manual steps above passed on **test** (operator confirmation after latest `test` deploy).
  - Production replay: same ordered pass on production after deploy.

- [ ] Final pre-prod gate
  - Change: Mark all required sections here as complete before running production rollout checklist.
  - Production replay: Execute checklist top-to-bottom with no skipped items.

## Update log

- 2026-05-12: **Lounge regression pass (`test` `3578e6c`):** feed/detail/quote-sheet carousels reset slide 1 using **`visibilityResetRootRef`** + `IntersectionObserver` on the media strip (not viewport-only); quote repost compose **min height** + `rows={5}`; **remove quote** = short **bottom** confirm: *“Are you sure you want to delete your quote of this post?”* with Cancel / Delete. **Manual test list:** (1) Feed multi-image: swipe to slide 2+, scroll post off and on in the Lounge list — lands on slide 1. (2) Post detail: same if the post has multiple images and you scroll within the detail panel. (3) Quote repost: open composer — gray “Add a comment” visible with several lines of vertical space; toolbar still directly under text; media below. (4) Remove quote: Repost → Remove quote — bottom sheet copy matches above; Cancel closes; Delete removes and feed updates. (5) `npm run lint` + `npm run build` clean. Smoke steps 7 and 10 in this file updated to match.
- 2026-05-11: **Doc sync (Lounge continuity):** profile **`handle_changed_at`** + 7-day cooldown SQL and client modals; iOS profile-save mitigations; rate-limit banner above composer; feed carousel first-slide on re-entry; anchored repost menus; quote composer height — reflected in **`AGENTS.md`**, **`docs/social-feed-roadmap.md`** (Phases A4, C, D deliverable, F), **`docs/frontend-architecture.md`** (`lounge/` table), and this backlog (A1 bullet, A4 UX, FE rows, smoke 6–10). Code on branch **`test`** (commit `d7c3ffd` area).
- 2026-05-10: **`profiles.has_active_subscription`** + guard trigger (**`supabase/profiles_tier_testing.sql`**); app reads role + flag for hamburger locks; **`docs/test-user-roles.md`** for SQL recipes.
- 2026-05-09: **Lounge interactions (Phase E/F slice):** added `supabase/feed_interactions_phase_ef.sql` (`post_likes`, `post_reposts`, `post_bookmarks`, `feed_comments`, `repost_count`, count triggers, RLS); client persistence + comments UI in **`SocialFeed.jsx`** / **`LoungePostArticle.jsx`**; feed selects include **`repost_count`** in **`AppShell.jsx`**. **Requires applying the new SQL on test.** Profile **follows** unchanged (`profile_follows` in `profile_lounge_fullscreen.sql`).
- 2026-05-10: **Removed `allowed_emails` / whitelist** from **`App.jsx`**; authenticated users always get member shell (documented in README + **`docs/frontend-architecture.md`**). Optional: drop unused **`public.allowed_emails`** table/policies in Supabase when ops are ready.
- 2026-05-10: Hamburger menu: **lock icons** on Calcs / AP Guides / Bankroll for free members without active subscription; **`VITE_HAS_ACTIVE_SUBSCRIPTION`** stub + **`profiles.role`** staff bypass; Offers row unlocked (per access spec).
