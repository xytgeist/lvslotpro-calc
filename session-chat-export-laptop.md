### User

please read in the SESSION_HANDOFF.md file

### Assistant

Read **`20260430_SESSION_HANDOFF.md`** in the repo root (dated 2026-04-30). Here is a concise summary:

### Product (PhoenixLinkCalc)
- Social-style +EV feed; long term subscription for tools + feed.
- **Now:** Vite + React with slot calculators and an **offers calendar** (manual events, uploads → OpenAI OCR → drafts + review).
- **Planned:** AP slot guides catalog, bankroll/income tracker, how-to content, **Vercel + Supabase + Resend**.

### Stack
- React 19, Vite, Tailwind 4, Chart.js, Supabase client; large `App.jsx`; offers under `src/features/offers/`; Edge Function `process-offer-uploads`; SQL under `supabase/*.sql`.

### DB: machines + guides
- Tables **`machines`** (42 titles) and **`guides`** (markdown, FK to machine); public read on machines and **published** guides only.
- Schema + seed in git: **`supabase/machines_guides_schema.sql`** — section 5 uses **TRUNCATE + re-seed**; avoid blind re-run in prod once real guides exist.

### Constraints
- Use **`https://www.machinepro.club/`** (www); no bulk scraping of member-only content; own/licensed catalog content; **Slots** folder as structure + approved sources, not wholesale copying.

### Status
- No open coding task from that thread.
- Guides: machines as checklist; guide rows authored over time (SQL or future admin).
- Likely next: bankroll/income tracker + Supabase; wire app to machines/guides; subscription later.

### Resume checklist (from the file)
1. This handoff + `package.json` + relevant `supabase/*.sql`.
2. For UI: grep `App.jsx` for nav/Supabase patterns; prefer `src/features/...` for big additions.

If you want to continue from here, say which of those “likely next” items you want first (e.g. wire machines/guides in the app vs. bankroll tracker).

### User

I want you to write our chat history to this file every 30 minutes

### Assistant

Exploring Cursor hooks and project setup so we can implement periodic chat-history logging.

### Assistant

Checking agent transcript format and whether we can append readable history.

### Assistant

Cursor can't run on a 30-minute timer by itself. Implementing a Node script that reads Cursor's on-disk agent transcripts and appends new messages to the handoff file, plus a PowerShell script to register a Windows Scheduled Task that runs every 30 minutes.

### Assistant

Implementing the export script and scheduled-task registration, and adding a brief note to the handoff file.

### Assistant

Creating the export script, registration script, `.gitignore` entry, and a short handoff section.

### Assistant

Fixing PowerShell 5.1 compatibility in the registration script (`?.` isn't supported).

### Assistant

Here is what is going on and what was added.

### What I cannot do in-chat
I only run when you send a message. I have no way to wake up every 30 minutes and edit a file. The practical approach is **automation on your machine** that reads Cursor’s saved transcripts and **appends** to your handoff file.

### What was implemented
1. **`scripts/cursor-chat-export.mjs`**  
   - Resolves the transcript folder as  
     `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\projects\c-Users-inves-Documents-LVSlotPro\agent-transcripts`  
     (same rule Cursor uses for this repo).  
   - Picks the **newest** `…/<uuid>/<uuid>.jsonl` session file.  
   - Tracks the last exported line in **`.cursor/chat-export-state.json`** (gitignored).  
   - Appends a dated `## Chat export (ISO timestamp)` block plus **User** / **Assistant** text to **`20260430_SESSION_HANDOFF.md`**.  
   - Optional env: `CURSOR_AGENT_TRANSCRIPTS`, `CHAT_EXPORT_HANDOFF`.

2. **`scripts\Register-CursorChatExportScheduledTask.ps1`**  
   - Registers Windows task **`LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport`** to run that script **every 30 minutes** (Node must be on `PATH` for the task).

3. **Handoff file** — new section **“Automated chat transcript exports”** explains the above. A test run already appended this thread’s transcript to the end of that file.

4. **`.gitignore`** — ignores `.cursor/chat-export-state.json`.

### What you do once
From PowerShell in the repo:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\inves\Documents\LVSlotPro
.\scripts\Register-CursorChatExportScheduledTask.ps1
```

If Windows asks for permission, approve it. To remove the task later:

```powershell
Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport' -Confirm:$false
```

### Caveats (worth knowing)
- Exports come from **Cursor’s JSONL transcripts**, not a live “memory” of the chat; some segments show as **``** by design.  
- With **several chats open**, “newest `.jsonl` by time” decides which thread is exported.  
- The handoff file will **grow** with each new batch; you can point exports elsewhere with `CHAT_EXPORT_HANDOFF` if you prefer a separate log file.

### User

will this script be able to run on multiple desktops?

### Assistant

Yes, with the right expectations.

### Multiple physical PCs
- The script runs **wherever you install it** and register the task. Each PC has its own Cursor data under that user’s `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\projects\...`, so each machine exports **that machine’s** chats into **that machine’s** copy of `20260430_SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.
- Register the scheduled task **on each Windows desktop** (`Register-CursorChatExportScheduledTask.ps1` once per machine).
- If the repo is synced (Git, OneDrive, etc.), you’ll get **different append blocks per machine** in the same file over time; merges can conflict if both edit the handoff. Easiest fix: only enable the scheduled task on one PC, or set `CHAT_EXPORT_HANDOFF` to a **machine-specific** or **gitignored** log file on each box.

### Same PC, multiple “desktops” (virtual desktops)
- No difference: one Cursor install, one transcript location, one task. It’s fine.

### Same PC, multiple clone folders
- The transcript path is derived from the **full workspace path**. A clone at `D:\work\LVSlotPro` uses a different `.cursor\projects\...` slug than `C:\Users\...\LVSlotPro`. Point `CURSOR_AGENT_TRANSCRIPTS` at the right folder if you ever need to override.

**Bottom line:** It runs on multiple desktops **independently** per machine; syncing one handoff file across machines needs a small policy (one writer, or separate output files per machine).

### User

lets do this...lets create separate tasks that i can call from either my laptop of destop...this should fix any conflicts in log data. Meaning I'll install the "laptop" script on laptop and "desktop" script on desktop and they will create different log files

### Assistant

Splitting registration into laptop and desktop tasks that write separate log files. Checking current scripts and handoff section.

_Source: `2d78ab45-ccb2-4a9f-8278-96a34c5e2dd9` — lines 21–28_

### Assistant

Implementing per-machine state files and separate runner + registration scripts for laptop and desktop.

### Assistant

Here is what changed.

### Separate logs
| Machine | Register script | Scheduled task | Output file | State file (gitignored) |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Laptop** | `scripts\Register-CursorChatExportScheduledTask-Laptop.ps1` | `LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport_Laptop` | `session-chat-export-laptop.md` | `.cursor/chat-export-state-laptop.json` |
| **Desktop** | `scripts\Register-CursorChatExportScheduledTask-Desktop.ps1` | `LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport_Desktop` | `session-chat-export-desktop.md` | `.cursor/chat-export-state-desktop.json` |

### Runners (what the tasks call)
- `scripts\Run-CursorChatExport-Laptop.ps1` — sets `CHAT_EXPORT_HANDOFF` + `CHAT_EXPORT_STATE_ID=laptop`, then runs Node on `cursor-chat-export.mjs`.
- `scripts\Run-CursorChatExport-Desktop.ps1` — same for desktop.

Tasks use `powershell.exe -File …` so environment variables are set reliably.

### Core script
- `cursor-chat-export.mjs` uses **`.cursor/chat-export-state-<CHAT_EXPORT_STATE_ID>.json`** (default id `default` if you call Node without a runner).
- Doc comment updated to point at the laptop/desktop register scripts.

### Removed / docs
- Removed **`Register-CursorChatExportScheduledTask.ps1`** (single-task version).
- **`20260430_SESSION_HANDOFF.md`**: replaced the old “append here” instructions with the laptop/desktop flow and removed the earlier test dump that was inlined in that file.
- **`.gitignore`**: `.cursor/chat-export-state-*.json`.

### What you do on each PC
**Laptop:**  
`cd` to repo → `.\scripts\Register-CursorChatExportScheduledTask-Laptop.ps1`

**Desktop:**  
`cd` to repo → `.\scripts\Register-CursorChatExportScheduledTask-Desktop.ps1`

If you ever registered the old task:  
`Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport' -Confirm:$false`

A quick test on this machine wrote **`session-chat-export-laptop.md`** in the repo root; you can commit both `session-chat-export-*.md` files as they diverge per machine without touching the same path.

**Note:** If the repo lives at **different paths** on laptop vs desktop, each side still uses its own Cursor transcript folder for that path; the two markdown files keep Git merges clean.

### User

im confused, how do i set up the task to run

### Assistant

Here’s a simple setup flow.

### Before you start
- **Node.js** installed and working in a normal terminal (`node -v`).
- Repo folder path known, e.g. `C:\Users\inves\Documents\LVSlotPro`.

### On your **laptop** (only laptop task)
1. Open **PowerShell** (not necessarily admin; use admin only if Windows asks).
2. Go to the repo:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\inves\Documents\LVSlotPro
   ```
3. Register the task:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Register-CursorChatExportScheduledTask-Laptop.ps1
   ```
4. You should see a message that **`LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport_Laptop`** was registered.  
   Logs go to **`session-chat-export-laptop.md`** in the repo root.

### On your **desktop** (only desktop task)
Same steps, but use the desktop script:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\inves\Documents\LVSlotPro
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Register-CursorChatExportScheduledTask-Desktop.ps1
```

That creates **`LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport_Desktop`** and logs to **`session-chat-export-desktop.md`**.

### Check that it’s there
- Press **Win**, type **Task Scheduler**, open it → **Task Scheduler Library** → look for **`LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport_Laptop`** or **`...Desktop`**.
- Or in PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport_*'
  ```

### Run it once by hand (optional)
```powershell
cd C:\Users\inves\Documents\LVSlotPro
.\scripts\Run-CursorChatExport-Laptop.ps1
```
(or `Run-CursorChatExport-Desktop.ps1` on the desktop)

### If you get “cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled”
Using `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ...` for the **register** scripts (as above) usually avoids that. If your **profile** blocks things, run PowerShell **as Administrator** once and try again.

### Timing
The task is set to repeat **every 30 minutes** after it’s registered. The first run follows the scheduler’s next trigger (often within 30 minutes); use the manual run above if you want an immediate test.

### Remove a task (if you need to)
```powershell
Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport_Laptop' -Confirm:$false
Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport_Desktop' -Confirm:$false
```

**Rule of thumb:** run **only the Laptop** register script on the laptop, and **only the Desktop** register script on the desktop, so each machine writes its own log file.

## Chat export (2026-05-02T03:01:40.321Z)

### User

how can i check how often it runs

### Assistant

Here are practical ways to see **how often** it runs.

### Task Scheduler (GUI)
1. **Win** → type **Task Scheduler** → open it.
2. **Task Scheduler Library** (left tree).
3. Click **`LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport_Laptop`** or **`...Desktop`**.
4. Open the **Triggers** tab — you should see something like **“At …”** with **“Repeat task every: 30 minutes”** (wording varies slightly by Windows version).
5. **History** tab (if enabled) shows past runs; if History is disabled, use PowerShell below.

### PowerShell (triggers + repetition)
```powershell
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport_Laptop' |
  Select-Object -ExpandProperty Triggers |
  Format-List *
```
Look for **`Repetition`** → **`Interval`** (e.g. `PT30M` = every 30 minutes) and **`Duration`**.

For the desktop task, use `LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport_Desktop`.

### Last / next run times
```powershell
Get-ScheduledTaskInfo -TaskName 'LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport_Laptop' |
  Format-List LastRunTime, NextRunTime, NumberOfMissedRuns, TaskName
```

### Command-line summary
```powershell
schtasks /Query /TN "LVSlotPro_CursorChatExport_Laptop" /V /FO LIST
```
Scroll for **Repeat: Every** and **Next Run Time**.

---

**What you should see:** repeat **every 30 minutes**, because that’s what `Register-CursorChatExportScheduledTask-*.ps1` sets (`RepetitionInterval` 30 minutes). If anything looks different, say which task name you opened and we can interpret it.

### User

read in the lastest messages from session-chat-export-desktop to understand what we've been doing

### Assistant

Here is what **`session-chat-export-desktop.md`** shows you were doing, in order through the latest export.

### Cursor chat export (setup)
- **`Register-CursorChatExportScheduledTask-Desktop.ps1`** only registers the task; it does not create **`session-chat-export-desktop.md`**.
- The markdown is produced when **`Run-CursorChatExport-Desktop.ps1`** (or the scheduled task) runs **`cursor-chat-export.mjs`**.
- A bug was fixed: project slugs under `.cursor/projects/` had **spaces** in path segments (e.g. `Ryan Franklin`), so transcripts were not found and no file was written. **Spaces in segments are normalized to hyphens**; after that, export worked.

### Product context
- You pointed the assistant at **`20260430_SESSION_HANDOFF.md`**: PhoenixLinkCalc / Machine Pro Club stack (Vite, React, Supabase, offers, machines/guides schema, constraints around **https://www.machinepro.club/** and licensing).

### AP Guides UI
- You specified a **Guides** experience: search, **+EV-focused cards** (image, volatility, distributor, popularity, added/updated), calculator button, **“Ask community”** → form → **home feed**, expand for full markdown guide; **Buffalo Link** as first example (public/original copy, not scraped paywall content).
- Implementation included **`GuidesScreen`**, **`buffaloLinkGuideDemo.js`**, **`community_feed_posts`** migration, optional **`guides_machine_card_fields.sql`**, **`App.jsx`** wiring, **`react-markdown`**, home feed from **`community_feed_posts`**.
- You reported the **hamburger “Guides” item** still looked old; it was updated to **AP Guides** with hint text, wider menu, clearing calculator when leaving Calcs, matching screen title.

### Latest request (end of export)
- You asked: **“ok, please do a card for phoenix link”**.
- The assistant described adding **`phoenixLinkGuideDemo.js`**, merging Phoenix into **`GuidesScreen`** when there is no DB row, orange accents for Phoenix, hero **`/phoenix-link-logo.png`**, calculator mapping **`phoenix-link` → `phoenix`**, sorted cards (Buffalo then Phoenix).

So the thread left off with **Phoenix Link** being added as a second demo card alongside Buffalo, with the same patterns and Supabase overrides when real rows exist. If you want to continue from here, say whether you want to verify those files in the repo, adjust copy/UI, or wire more machines.

### User

great...just wanted you to know where we left off...we actually did the phoenix link card already as well as a card for stack up pays

### Assistant

Noted — the desktop export stopped before those landed. Verifying the repo for Phoenix Link and Stack Up Pays so our context matches the code.

### Assistant

Thanks for the correction — the desktop export ended right after the Phoenix Link write-up, so it never reflected **Stack Up Pays** or the final merged state.

In the repo now I see all three demos wired in **`GuidesScreen.jsx`**: **`buffaloLinkGuideDemo.js`**, **`phoenixLinkGuideDemo.js`**, and **`stackUpPaysGuideDemo.js`** (`stack-up-pays` with cyan styling, `/stackup-icon.jpg`, calculator mapping to **`stackup`**). I will treat **Buffalo Link, Phoenix Link, and Stack Up Pays** as the current demo card set unless Supabase rows override them.

Whenever you want to extend guides (another title, seed data, or feed tweaks), we can pick up from there.

### User

read our session chat backup (laptop) to catch up to where we left off

### Assistant

Reading the laptop session chat backup.

### Assistant

Here is a concise catch-up from **`session-chat-export-laptop.md`**.

### Project context (from earlier in the thread)
- **PhoenixLinkCalc / Machine Pro Club**: Vite + React, Supabase, offers calendar, machines/guides schema; constraints in **`20260430_SESSION_HANDOFF.md`** (e.g. **https://www.machinepro.club/**, licensing, no wholesale copying).
- **Guides UI**: search, +EV-style cards, calculator, “Ask community” → feed, markdown expansion; demo content (Buffalo first, then Phoenix, etc.).

### What you built in that session
- **Automated chat exports**: Node script **`scripts/cursor-chat-export.mjs`**, per-machine runners and **Scheduled Tasks** so laptop vs desktop append to **`session-chat-export-laptop.md`** vs **`session-chat-export-desktop.md`** (avoids merge fights on one file). Desktop side also fixed **spaces in `.cursor/projects/` path segments** so transcripts resolve.
- **Guides**: **`GuidesScreen`**, hamburger **“AP Guides”**, demo guides, **`community_feed_posts`**, optional SQL for card fields, **`react-markdown`**, etc.
- **Demo cards**: Per the **latest** messages in this laptop export, you already finished **Phoenix Link** and **Stack Up Pays** in addition to Buffalo; the assistant verified three demos in **`GuidesScreen.jsx`**: `buffaloLinkGuideDemo.js`, `phoenixLinkGuideDemo.js`, `stackUpPaysGuideDemo.js` (Stack Up Pays → cyan styling, `/stackup-icon.jpg`, calculator mapping **`stackup`**).

### Where things stand
- No open coding task was pinned at the very end; the thread closed with “we can extend guides (another title, seed data, feed tweaks) from here.”
- Practical next steps from the handoff are still things like **bankroll/income tracker**, deeper **Supabase** wiring for real guide rows vs demos, or **subscription** later—only if you want to prioritize one of those.

If you tell me what you want to do next (e.g. another machine card, seed SQL, or feed behavior), we can continue from that.

### User

lets start building the must hit by card

### Assistant

Exploring the codebase to find how cards and calculators are built so we can add a "must hit by" card consistently.

### Assistant

Inspecting how guide demo cards are structured and wired into `GuidesScreen`.

### Assistant

Adding an AP Guides demo card for Must Hit By that matches existing guide demos and wires to `MHBCalculator` (`mhb`). Creating the demo module, a small hero asset, and updating `GuidesScreen.jsx`.

### Assistant

Updating `GuidesScreen.jsx` to import the demo and wire styling, merge logic, calculator resolution, and card bullets.

### Assistant

Here is what was added for the **Must Hit By** AP Guides card.

### 1. `src/features/guides/mustHitByGuideDemo.js`
- Slug constant: `must-hit-by-jackpot` (same as the merged machine row).
- Three **+EV-style card bullets** (meter vs cap, meter rise / RTP, in-app calculator).
- Full **markdown guide**: MHB concept, stopping rules (midpoint vs cap), floor notes, bankroll, how to use **`MHBCalculator`**.

### 2. `public/mhb-jackpot-hero.svg`
- Purple / fuchsia gradient hero so the card matches the **Calculators → Must Hit By Jackpot** styling without depending on PNGs that may not be in the repo.

### 3. `GuidesScreen.jsx`
- Merges the demo when Supabase does **not** already have that machine slug (same pattern as Buffalo / Phoenix / Stack Up Pays).
- **`resolveCalculatorKey`**: `must-hit-by-jackpot` and `calculator_slug === 'mhb'` → opens **`mhb`** (`MHBCalculator`).
- Card bullets, **violet/fuchsia** accents, hero, gradient overlay, focus ring, and markdown **h2** tone for this slug.

In **AP Guides**, you should see **Must Hit By Jackpot** (manufacturer **Various**, type **Must-Hit-By Progressive**) with **Open calculator** → existing MHB tool and **Ask community** wired like the other cards.

**Note:** `npm run build` failed on resolving `react-markdown` in this environment; that looks like a local `node_modules` / install issue, not these edits. After `npm install`, run `npm run build` again on your machine.

If you add a real **`guides` + `machines`** row later with the same slug (or `calculator_slug: 'mhb'`), the local demo is skipped automatically. If you want a **title-specific** MHB guide next (e.g. a named progressive), say which title and we can clone this pattern with its own slug and copy.

### User

specify this particular one as Ainsworth must hit bys and all the info you need for the card is at https://wizardofodds.com/games/slots/mystery-jackpot-ainsworth/

### Assistant

Retargeting the guide demo to Ainsworth must-hit-by progressives using the Wizard of Odds article: updating the demo module and GuidesScreen references (slug, styling, merge row).

### Assistant

Rewriting the demo module for Ainsworth-specific content (paraphrased, with a citation to Wizard of Odds) and updating `GuidesScreen.jsx` to use slug `ainsworth-must-hit-by`.

### Assistant

Here is what changed.

### `mustHitByGuideDemo.js`
- Card is explicitly **Ainsworth** must-hit-by / **mystery** progressives, aligned with [Wizard of Odds — Must-Hit-By Progressives on Ainsworth Slots](https://wizardofodds.com/games/slots/mystery-jackpot-ainsworth/).
- **Slug** is now `ainsworth-must-hit-by` (`AINSWORTH_MUST_HIT_BY_DEMO_SLUG`).
- **Card bullets:** uniform random target between reset and cap, **% meter rise**; **Red Rock 2013 sample** (Minor $20→$50 @ 0.45%, Major $350→$400 @ 0.20%) with a clear “verify on your glass” note; **AGS** warning (do not use the same model).
- **Full guide:** WOO link as primary reference, four-rule summary, markdown table for that historical sample, **t = m × (h + r) / (h + 2r)** with definitions, **Major $370 / 10% HE → Minor ~$48.13** example, AGS caveat, how to combine **in-app MHB calc** with WOO’s **two-meter tables**.

### `GuidesScreen.jsx`
- Demo row title **“Ainsworth Must Hit By (Mystery Progressives)”**, machine **Ainsworth Must Hit By**, manufacturer **Ainsworth**, type **Must-Hit-By Mystery Progressive**.
- **`resolveCalculatorKey`:** `ainsworth-must-hit-by` still opens the existing **`mhb`** calculator.
- Styling/hero paths updated from `must-hit-by-jackpot` → `ainsworth-must-hit-by` (same purple hero SVG).

Content is **paraphrased** plus explicit credit and links to WOO; numbers and formula match what they publish for that article. If you later add a Supabase `machines` row, use slug **`ainsworth-must-hit-by`** and `calculator_slug: 'mhb'` so it stays consistent.

### User

please redo the card with the appropriate image saved in the Must Hit By AIG directory. Also please add Mustang Money, Winning Wolf, Dollar Action, Glitter Gems, Ming Warrior, Thunder Cash as named slot machine games (searchable)

### Assistant

Copying the hero image into `public` for Vite, wiring the card to it, and adding a searchable keyword blob plus visible game names in the guide content.

### Assistant

Updating the demo module, GuidesScreen (hero path, search, card “Known titles” row), and removing the unused SVG.

### Assistant

Here is what was done.

### Hero image
- **`Slots/Must Hit By AIG/Main Image.png`** was copied to **`public/ainsworth-must-hit-by-hero.png`** so Vite can serve it as **`/ainsworth-must-hit-by-hero.png`** (no spaces in the URL).
- **`GuidesScreen.jsx`** `defaultHeroSrc` for `ainsworth-must-hit-by` now points at that PNG.
- Removed the old placeholder **`public/mhb-jackpot-hero.svg`**.

If you replace the art under `Slots/Must Hit By AIG/`, run the same copy again (or we can add a small script later).

### Named games (search + UI)
- **`mustHitByGuideDemo.js`**
  - **`AINSWORTH_MHB_SEARCH_KEYWORDS`** — all six titles plus family terms, used only for search.
  - **`AINSWORTH_MHB_KNOWN_TITLES_LINE`** — one line for the card.
  - New markdown section **“Games you may see with this mystery MHB package”** listing Mustang Money, Winning Wolf, Dollar Action, Glitter Gems, Ming Warrior, Thunder Cash (with a short “verify on glass” caveat).
  - Card bullets refreshed (four bullets): WOO model, **cabinet titles + search**, Red Rock sample, AGS warning.
- **`GuidesScreen.jsx`**
  - Local demo row includes **`guide_search_text: AINSWORTH_MHB_SEARCH_KEYWORDS`** (client-only, not a DB column).
  - Search now also checks **`guide_search_text`**, **`content_markdown`**, and **`machines.type`** so queries like **mustang**, **ming warrior**, **thunder cash**, etc. surface this guide.
  - Collapsed card shows a **Known titles** row with the six names.

Supabase-backed guides do not get `guide_search_text` unless you add it later; for this demo, search is fully covered by the keywords field plus the new markdown body.

### User

Build Failed
Command "npm run build" exited with 1

### Assistant

Escaping backticks inside the template literal — they prematurely closed the string.

### Assistant

Fixed the syntax error. `react-markdown` is listed in `package.json` but missing from `node_modules`. Running `npm install` to restore dependencies.

### Assistant

Here’s what was going wrong and what we changed.

### 1. **Parse error in `mustHitByGuideDemo.js`**
The guide body is a **template literal** (backticks). This line used **inline backticks** for paths:

```text
**`Slots/Must Hit By AIG/Main Image.png`**
```

That **closed** the template string early, so the parser blew up around “Hero art…”. Those inner backticks were removed so the paths are only **bold** (no nested `` ` ``), which is valid JS and still fine in Markdown.

### 2. **`react-markdown` could not be resolved**
`react-markdown` is in **`package.json`** but it was **not installed** under `node_modules` (79 packages were added when we ran **`npm install`**). After that, **`npm run build`** completed successfully.

**For CI / Vercel:** ensure the install step runs with a lockfile in sync, e.g. **`npm ci`** (preferred in CI) or **`npm install`**, and that **`package-lock.json`** is committed if you use it.

If your deploy still fails, run **`npm install`** locally, commit any **`package-lock.json`** updates, and redeploy.

lets do the cards for AGS and IGT must hit bys

### Assistant

Exploring the Slots folder and the Ainsworth demo pattern so we can add AGS and IGT must-hit-by guide cards.

### Assistant

Copying hero images and adding AGS and IGT demo modules plus GuidesScreen wiring. Refactoring the “Known titles” row to use `row.known_titles_line`.

Here’s what was added.

### Assets
- **`Slots/Must Hit By AGS/Main IMage.png`** → **`public/ags-must-hit-by-hero.png`**
- **`Slots/Must Hit By IGT/IGT_Main_Image.png`** → **`public/igt-must-hit-by-hero.png`**

### New demo modules
- **`src/features/guides/agsMustHitByGuideDemo.js`** — slug **`ags-must-hit-by`**, AGS / Orion focus, **non-uniform / near-cap** behavior with a cite to [Wizard of Odds — Ainsworth mystery MHB](https://wizardofodds.com/games/slots/mystery-jackpot-ainsworth/) for the AGS caveat, searchable keywords, **Known titles** line (Emerald Princess, Dragon’s Jackpots, Gold Inferno, Orion family).
- **`src/features/guides/igtMustHitByGuideDemo.js`** — slug **`igt-must-hit-by`**, IGT + legacy **WMS-style** uniform mystery framing with cites to [Wizard of Odds — Must-Hit-By / mystery jackpot](https://wizardofodds.com/games/slots/mystery-jackpot/), Coyote Moon / Money Storm / Lobstermania as search anchors, note that not every cabinet is MHB.

Both wire to the existing **`mhb`** calculator like Ainsworth.

### **`GuidesScreen.jsx`**
- Merges both demos when those slugs are missing from Supabase.
- **`resolveCalculatorKey`:** `ags-must-hit-by`, `igt-must-hit-by`, `ainsworth-must-hit-by`, or **`calculator_slug === 'mhb'`** → **`mhb`**.
- Card bullets, **rose** (AGS) and **sky/blue** (IGT) accents, hero gradients, focus rings, default hero paths.
- **`known_titles_line`** on Ainsworth, AGS, and IGT rows; the **Known titles** UI now uses **`row.known_titles_line`** so any future demo can opt in the same way.

`npm run build` completes successfully.

### User

ok lets work on the MHB calculator a bit. FIrst i noticed theres an error with the reset value when changing the Must Hit By value to 10000. The Reset Value should cahnge to 9000

### Assistant

Adding `setResetValue(9000)` when switching to the 10000 preset and `setResetValue(350)` when switching back to 500 — the effect already updates current and meter rise but omitted reset.

### Assistant

Updating the Reset field's blur fallback so clearing it restores 9000 when Must Hit By is 10000, not 350.

### Assistant

Here’s what was wrong and what we changed.

**Issue:** The `useEffect` that runs when **Must Hit By** switches between **500** and **10000** updated **JP Meter (Current)** and **Meter Rise**, but never **Reset Value**, so it stayed at **350** after choosing **10000**.

**Change:**
1. When **Must Hit By** is **10000**, the effect now also calls **`setResetValue(9000)`**.
2. When it’s **500** again, it calls **`setResetValue(350)`** so the low-tier preset matches.
3. **Reset Value** `onChange` / `onBlur` defaults use **9000** vs **350** depending on the selected **Must Hit By**, so if the field is cleared and blurred, it snaps back to the right preset default.

```26:38:c:\Users\inves\Documents\LVSlotPro\src\calculators\MHBCalculator.jsx
  // Auto-adjust when MHB changes (paired presets: current, meter rise, reset)
  useEffect(() => {
    if (mustHitBy === 10000) {
      setCurrent(9802)
      setMeterRise(6.66666)
      setResetValue(9000)
    } else if (mustHitBy === 500) {
      setCurrent(475)
      setMeterRise(2.50)
      setResetValue(350)
    }
  }, [mustHitBy])
```

### User

lets add a drop down selector that allows the user to select from Ainsworth, AGS, IGT and changes the default MHB value (and all other values associated) when the user changes this

### Assistant

Adding a manufacturer dropdown and a preset table that updates current, must-hit-by tier, meter rise, reset, and RTP when the manufacturer or MHB tier changes.

### Assistant

Adding a preset map and manufacturer state, replacing the old `mustHitBy`-only effect, and wiring blur/calculate fallbacks to the active preset.

### Assistant

Here’s what was implemented.

### Manufacturer dropdown
Top of the main input card: **Ainsworth (uniform mystery)**, **AGS (late-band / near-cap)**, **IGT / WMS-style mystery)**, plus a short note that values are examples and should be checked on the glass.

### Preset table (`MHB_PRESETS`)
Changing **Manufacturer** or **Must Hit By (500 / 10000)** reapplies the bundle: **JP current**, **meter rise**, **reset**, and **RTP %** via a single `useEffect`.

| Maker      | Cap     | Current | Meter rise | Reset | RTP |
|-----------|---------|---------|------------|-------|-----|
| Ainsworth | 500     | 475     | 2.50       | 350   | 85  |
| Ainsworth | 10000   | 9802    | 6.66666    | 9000  | 85  |
| AGS       | 500     | 488     | 2.72       | 365   | 87  |
| AGS       | 10000   | 9895    | 7.05       | 9150  | 87  |
| IGT       | 500     | 462     | 2.35       | 338   | 85  |
| IGT       | 10000   | 9740    | 6.42       | 8850  | 85  |

AGS uses a **higher default RTP (87%)** and **tighter meter / rise** as a slightly more conservative illustration; you can change any number after it loads.

### Other behavior
- **`activePreset`** drives blur / empty-field fallbacks for current, RTP, meter rise, and reset.
- **`calculate()`** uses preset fallbacks when a numeric field is invalid, and **`overallRTP`** falls back to the active preset’s RTP if it’s not a number.

If you want these numbers tied to specific games or PAR sheets, say which and we can tune the table.
