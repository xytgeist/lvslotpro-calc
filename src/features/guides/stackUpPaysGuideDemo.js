Stack Up Pays on **IGT’s Ascending Fortunes** chassis is a **multi-meter persistent** game: coins or symbols increment **separate must-hit style ladders** that reset when hit. The commercial question is whether the **vector of all five meter positions** plus the **price per spin** implies a **favorable path** to completion versus the **base-game tax** you pay while moving them.

## The +EV picture (meter-first)

1. **Read every meter** — A “good” mega can be **cancelled** by four bad minors if you ignore cross-meter exposure. Build a **mental model of total dollars to clear** versus **expected payback** from the hit distribution you assume.
2. **SPI and must-hit bands** — **Spins per increment** and **reset vs must-hit span** control how expensive it is to move a meter one unit. Small errors in SPI assumptions **move the +EV threshold** a lot at tight margins.
3. **Calibration** — Use the calculator’s **cycle calibration** story: overall RTP splits into **base vs bonus share**, then meters scale with **position in band**. If your floor’s paytable or denom does not match your inputs, the tool is still **internally consistent** but not **floor-accurate**.

## How the game plays (floor-facing)

- **Base game:** Line pays and events that **feed meters**; you are almost always paying **negative base** to buy meter movement.
- **Features:** Meter hits pay from **configured average pay** bands; **marketing** and **link size** change realized distributions.
- **Denoms:** Confirm **qualifying bet** for each meter tier and whether **max bet** changes must-hit math on your cabinet revision.

## Bankroll and session hygiene

Multi-meter games **correlate bad runs**: several meters can stall in expensive territory at once. Size bets so a **single “bad cloud”** across meters does not wipe the session before the math can work.

## Using the Las Vegas Slot Pro calculator

Open **Stack Up Pays** from the card. Enter **overall RTP**, **denom**, **per-meter counter / must-hit / reset / SPI** (defaults match common training setups—always verify on the glass), and read **+EV counter**, **calibrated RTP**, and **expected bets won** for the stopping rule you use.
