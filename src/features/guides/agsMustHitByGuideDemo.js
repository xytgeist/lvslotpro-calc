**AGS** ships multiple **must-hit-by** and **mystery progressive** packages (often on **Orion** and related cabinets). The meters look similar to other makers—**reset**, **must-hit ceiling**, **visible climb**—but **advantage players widely report** that the **random trigger is not “flat”** across the whole range: **large awards may rarely fire far below the cap**, which breaks the **uniform target-point** shortcuts used for some other manufacturers.

The **AGS caveat** is spelled out in context on **[Must-Hit-By Progressives on Ainsworth Slots](https://wizardofodds.com/games/slots/mystery-jackpot-ainsworth/)** (Michael Shackleford, Wizard of Odds), because that page contrasts **Ainsworth-style uniform** behavior with **AGS-style** behavior.

## Games and cabinets you may hear in the same conversation

Marketing and links change by casino, but AP discussions often mention **AGS Orion** titles and progressives such as:

- **Emerald Princess** (Fa Cai Shu family / linked progressives on some installs)
- **Dragon’s Jackpots**
- **Gold Inferno**

Treat these as **search anchors**, not a promise that every bank uses the same **reset, cap, or meter-rise** schedule.

## Scouting and modeling discipline

1. **Assume “late-band” risk** — If the true hit distribution is **front-loaded near the cap**, your **effective cost** to realize the jackpot is **higher** than a uniform model implies until the meter is **very close** to must-hit.
2. **Verify rise and eligibility** — **Qualifying bet**, **denom**, and **link vs stand-alone** still dominate realized RTP; do not extrapolate from a **different property’s** PAR.
3. **Log your own samples** — Small **private hit logs** (counter at hit, denom, bet) beat forum lore when you are deciding whether a **uniform** approximation is “good enough” on a specific bank.

## Using the Las Vegas Slot Pro calculator

Open **Must Hit By Jackpot** from this card for **what-if** math on **current**, **cap**, **meter rise**, **reset**, and **RTP**. Read outputs as **upper-bound optimism** unless you have evidence the bank behaves **uniformly** through the band.
