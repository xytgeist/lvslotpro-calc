**IGT** (and **legacy WMS** content often found on IGT-managed floors) has a long line of **mystery / must-hit-by** style progressives: a **published ceiling**, a **meter that climbs with qualifying coin-in**, and a **hidden trigger threshold** chosen inside the band. Public **target-point** math is laid out on **[Must-Hit-By Progressives (WMS mystery jackpots)](https://wizardofodds.com/games/slots/mystery-jackpot/)** (Michael Shackleford, Wizard of Odds). That page assumes a **uniform** distribution between seed and cap—**do not** paste those conclusions onto **AGS** meters without a separate model.

Hero art for this card is sourced from **Slots/igt-must-hit-by/hero.webp** (bundled **/igt-must-hit-by-hero.webp** in the app **public** folder). A reference strip JPG in **Slots/igt-must-hit-by/** (Coyote Moon / Money Storm / Lobstermania) is useful for **visual ID**, not for PAR.

## Titles players often type into search

These are **common IGT / WMS brands** that sometimes appear with **incremental or mystery MHB** style meters (always **verify on the machine**):

- **Coyote Moon**
- **Money Storm**
- **Lucky Larry’s Lobstermania**

## How the +EV framing differs from Ainsworth-only notes

Where **uniform** mystery math is appropriate, the same **t = m × (h + r) / (h + 2r)** style thinking (see WOO) applies: you need **m** (cap), **r** (rise as a fraction of bet), and a defensible **h** (whole-game house edge including progressive contribution assumptions). **IGT revisions**, **link size**, and **denom** can all move **r** and **h** without changing the marquee art.

## Using the Las Vegas Slot Pro calculator

Open **Must Hit By Jackpot** from this card. Enter **current meter**, **must-hit cap**, **meter rise per penny**, **reset**, **overall RTP**, and compare **midpoint vs full run**. Cross-check breakeven / exposure against **[Wizard of Odds — mystery jackpot / must-hit-by](https://wizardofodds.com/games/slots/mystery-jackpot/)** for **table-based** target-point habits you use in scouting.
