      when_to_play: `**Primary play:** hunt **built multipliers** on the **ten money rolls** above the reels (persistent **per bet level**).

**Sit when any of these clear:**

- **Total multiplier sum ≥ 30×** across all ten rolls.
- **Two Purple rolls (50-credit base):** combined multipliers **≥ 8×** (e.g. 4× + 4×).
- **Red roll (100-credit base):** **≥ 3×** with some support from other rolls.
- **Two Blue rolls (20-credit base):** combined **≥ 10×** with other multiplier support.

**Do not** chase the **Yellow 1000** roll alone ... it rarely drives the bonus. **Turquoise (5)** and **Green (10)** rolls only matter when multipliers are absurdly high, not as the main reason to sit.`,
      when_to_stop: `Stop after the **Top Dollar-style bonus** finishes (four offers max) and multipliers **reset** on your bet level.`,
      how_to_check: `1. Read **each money roll's multiplier** above the reels (turquoise/green/blue/purple/red/yellow values are fixed).
2. Sum totals and check **purple pair / red / blue pair** lines above.
3. Cycle **every bet level** ... multipliers are **stored per bet** until the bonus fires.`,
      risk_bankroll: `**500 units** ... you are paying to sit until **three Easy Money Deluxe symbols** hit a payline and the multiplied roll values pay out.`,
      risk_summary: `Classic **9-line** feel with a modern persistent layer. Multipliers **randomly tick up** during base play, then lock until the feature.

Bonus flow: multiplied roll values get summed into **offers** ... accept or try again up to **four** times (final offer is forced).`,

Each roll carries its own **multiplier** that grows during base play. **Three Easy Money Deluxe symbols** on a line trigger the **Top Dollar-style** pick ... current multipliers apply to roll values before offers are built.`,

**Primary play:**

- **Any yellow orb** on the reels **or** bottom slot of the upcoming queue.
- **Two yellow orbs** anywhere in the upcoming queue.
- **Four red orbs** on the board.
- **Six orbs of any color** ... value is **free games lottery**, not credit prizes (blue credits are tiny).

**Pyramid symbols** drop the bottom queued orb into the **sixth reel** on that row. Orbs **shift left** each spin. Orb on pyramid = credit win + chance at **Inner Reel Feature** (multiplier, major/grand, or free games).`,
      when_to_stop: `Stop after **free games** or the **Inner Reel** sequence you chased finishes and the board clears.`,
      how_to_check: `1. Count **yellow / red / blue orbs** on reels plus the **queue** right of the character.
2. Ignore **reel 1 orbs** and unrevealed queue values until they drop.
3. **Menu → bet arrows** can cycle levels without coin-in on many Gaming Arts installs.
4. Cycle **all bet levels** otherwise.`,
      risk_bankroll: `**100 units** ... high variance; most sessions lose until a big Inner Reel or free games hit.`,
      risk_summary: `Orbs **persist after triggering** ... same orb can pay multiple times. Multiple pyramids in a row **multiply** the dropping orb value.

**Inner Reel Feature** on trigger can add **2×–50×**, a **major/grand**, or **free games**. Two theme skins share one engine.`,
